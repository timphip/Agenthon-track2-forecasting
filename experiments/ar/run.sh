# ## Executive summary (read this first)
# Run the Track-2 worked exemplar with four fitted AR(1) yield models.
#
# It runs end to end with ONLY numpy + pandas + the shared qfbench2_common toolkit
# (no foundation-model weights, no network):
#   1. loads the synthetic input panel rates_daily.parquet (as-of 2024-06-28);
#   2. runs one AR(1) model per tenor and simulates correlated residuals
#      to produce a schema-valid joint forecast over UST_2Y/5Y/10Y/30Y @ horizon 21;
#   3. writes forecast.parquet + forecast_meta.json into ./output/;
#   4. runs the public smoke scorer (gates g0-g3); no realized outcomes are shipped
#      publicly, so the score is reported as None ("public smoke") — gates still run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash experiments/ar/run.sh                # from the repo root
#   COMMON=/path/to/common bash experiments/ar/run.sh # optional toolkit

## Method

Four separate AR(1) models: for each tenor, tomorrow's rate equals a fitted
intercept plus a fitted coefficient times today's rate plus a random residual.
The coefficients use observations dated no later than {ASOF}. Each of {N_DRAWS}
simulated paths advances {HORIZONS[0]} business days. Same-day historical
residual correlation couples the four tenors. No FOMC text is read.

## What the text corpus contributed

Nothing in this run. This is the statistical baseline: it reads the numeric panel only, and the
text corpus at `/input/text/` is left unread. It is included as the floor a reasoning agent has
to beat, not as an example of using text.

A reasoning agent would read the two dated FOMC documents in this unit's corpus and adjust the
level and spread — the June 2024 statement's rate-hold language and the "greater confidence"
framing bear directly on the front end, and should move 2Y more than 30Y.

## What would change this forecast

A shift in the FOMC's characterisation of inflation progress, or a payrolls surprise large
enough to reprice the front end. Neither is observable at the as-of date.
