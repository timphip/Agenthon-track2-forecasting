# QFBench 2.0 Track-2 reference submission image.
#
# Follows the shape the other tracks already use on the shared dev box: the verb is an
# executable on PATH, CMD is the verb plus --help so `docker run <img>` is self-describing,
# and the harness overrides argv with the real invocation.

# Builds and runs on linux/arm64 (verified on GH200) and linux/amd64.

# Python 3.13. `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.13"` and CI runs 3.13; a 3.12 base
# here meant the image could not install the package it exists to run, and that contradiction sat
# unnoticed because nothing ever installed the package into the image.

# Pinned. The scorer's own CI was red for a week because a pinned type checker met an unpinned
# numpy; a submission image that floats its deps has the same failure mode with worse timing.
#
# `qfbench2-common` is required, not optional: `qfbench2_track_forecasting.limits` imports
# `qfbench2_common.contracts`, so an image without it BUILDS CLEANLY and then dies on the first
# `forecast` call. Measured before this line existed: build exit 0, `forecast --help` exit 1 with
# ModuleNotFoundError.
#
# Same repository and tag the README installs, in the TARBALL form rather than `git+https://`.
# That is deliberate: the base image is `python:3.13-slim-bookworm`, which ships no `git`, so the
# `git+` form fails at build time with "Cannot find command 'git'". The tarball needs no VCS
# client and no extra apt layer.
